# Exercises for distributed systems

## Goal

The goal of the exercises was to undestand how threads work and how to initiate them.
Excercises 1 and 2 are not threads are meant to be used, but illustrate the logic behind Threads.

## Disclaimer

Not all of the code is made by me, but the logic in main(), run() and some of the sorting/grading methods are.
